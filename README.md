# A little information about me!

### I am Hector, currently a PhD Student at the Hydrology department. Doing my PhD in Environmental Engineering.

**I am learning GIS from 15 months both at College and home with the help of Professors, various Communities, and blogs**. 

*I started using ArcGIS pro because of this GIS program which was the first experience. And since then, I found it very useful and a great tool that could be integrated into any Project and no matter what subject you deal with!*

> I hope to get out of this class to find paid tools/packages (from ArcGIS) in QGIS to be used in Python code. 

I think that a open source platform allows you to freely: 
1. use, 
2. modify, and
3. redistribute any tools/packages. 

###*And my only hobby is eating spicy foods :S*###
